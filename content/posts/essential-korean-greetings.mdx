# Essential Korean Greetings

Learning greetings is the first step in any language. Korean has different levels of formality, so the greeting you use depends on who you're talking to.

## Formal Greetings

### 안녕하세요 (annyeonghaseyo)

This is the most versatile greeting. It works in almost every situation — meeting someone new, greeting a coworker, or entering a shop.

> **Tip:** Koreans often give a slight bow when saying 안녕하세요.

### 감사합니다 (gamsahamnida)

"Thank you" in formal Korean. You'll use this dozens of times a day in Seoul.

## Casual Greetings

### 안녕 (annyeong)

The casual version of hello — use it only with close friends or people younger than you.

### 고마워 (gomawo)

Casual "thanks." Save this for friends!

## Quick Reference

| Korean | Romanization | Meaning | Formality |
|--------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| 안녕하세요 | annyeonghaseyo | Hello | Polite |
| 안녕 | annyeong | Hi / Bye | Casual |
| 감사합니다 | gamsahamnida | Thank you | Formal |
| 고마워 | gomawo | Thanks | Casual |
| 잘 가 | jal ga | Goodbye (to someone leaving) | Casual |
| 안녕히 가세요 | annyeonghi gaseyo | Goodbye (formal) | Polite |

## Practice

Try using **안녕하세요** next time you walk into a Korean restaurant. Even a small effort goes a long way — Koreans really appreciate it when foreigners try to speak Korean!
