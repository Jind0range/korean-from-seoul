# Understanding Korean Particles: 은/는 vs 이/가

If you've been studying Korean for a while, you've probably stumbled on this question: **when do I use 은/는 and when do I use 이/가?**

You're not alone. This is one of the most commonly asked questions by Korean learners.

## The Short Answer

- **은/는** = **Topic** marker ("As for X...")
- **이/가** = **Subject** marker ("X does something")

## 은/는 — Topic Particle

Use 은 after a consonant, 는 after a vowel.

This particle marks the **topic** of the sentence — what you're talking about.

**저는 학생이에요.**
*jeoneun haksaengieyo*
"(As for me,) I am a student."

**한국어는 재미있어요.**
*hangugeo-neun jaemiisseoyo*
"(As for Korean,) it's fun."

## 이/가 — Subject Particle

Use 이 after a consonant, 가 after a vowel.

This particle marks the **subject** — who or what is performing the action.

**비가 와요.**
*biga wayo*
"Rain is falling." (It's raining.)

**고양이가 귀여워요.**
*goyangi-ga gwiyeowoyo*
"The cat is cute."

## When to Use Which?

### New vs Known Information

- **이/가** introduces **new** information
- **은/는** refers to **already known** information

**A:** 누가 왔어요? (Who came?)
**B:** 민수**가** 왔어요. (Minsu came.) — new info → 이/가

**A:** 민수는 어디 있어요? (Where is Minsu?) — known topic → 은/는

### Contrast

**은/는** is also used for **contrast**:

**커피는 좋아해요, 차는 안 좋아해요.**
"I like coffee, but I don't like tea."

## Practice Tip

Don't overthink it at first. Start by defaulting to **은/는** for the topic of your sentence, and use **이/가** when answering "who?" or "what?" questions. Over time, it becomes natural!

화이팅! (You can do it!)
